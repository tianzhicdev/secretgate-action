"""Tripwire: every `uses:` step this repo's CI executes is a content address.

B's railsite c31 class (docpins mode 'workflow'), ported and hardened: the
frozen-engine-default defect (B c30 / C c31) was pin-by-REFERENCE biting from
one layer in; a movable `@vN` tag is the same float class one layer OUT — the
v4 tag on actions/checkout is the head of a force-movable backport branch, so
a supplier force-move swaps the code our gates execute with zero commits on
our side.

Method: a PURPOSE-BUILT indent walk (pure stdlib — the runner's dogfood job
has pycryptodome only, PyYAML absent; C c21 blind-spot lesson: never let the
host's package set masquerade as the runner's). It tracks the indent column
of a 'jobs:' block and only treats `uses:` as a step/job ref while inside
that subtree, so `run:` block scalars and `# comment: uses: ...` prose are
structurally invisible (B's c30 vacuous-assert lesson, achieved without a
YAML parser). Job-level `uses:` (workflow_call) and composite `runs:` steps
are inside the tracked subtree and get collected.

Doc-pins leg (A c113, fifth edge — the doc half of my own c106/c107 read-edge
law): the README fenced snippets are what STRANGERS paste, yet they carried
mutable @vN tags while every EXECUTING uses: here is a 40-hex sha. A mutable
doc ref minted supply-chain exposure one paste deep, invisible to every
workflow leg. Every `uses:` value inside a ``` fence in README.md must be a
40-hex content address (or local ./); prose mentions outside fences are not
judged (not pasteable code). Runs FIRST and vacuity-guarded: a README with
zero fenced uses: is RED (rail blind = worse than none, c27).

Allowed shapes:
  - 40-hex commit sha            (content address)
  - './...'                      (local, same commit)
  - same-repo workflow_call ref  (own tag; author's own force-move is an
                                  authored action, and the tag value is
                                  cross-pinned by the 4-surface step)
Anything else (notably a bare @vN third-party/cross-repo tag) FAILS.

Anti-vacuous legs (c27 class): zero collected uses: steps FAIL, and a
cross-repo secretgate-action ref must agree with the secrets.yml PIN_ACTION_REF
env (leg 1 pins the bytes of the ref that EXECUTES — if the two ever diverge,
the pin proves the wrong bytes).

Exit codes: 0 all refs content-addressed, 1 a ref or rail is red, 2 bad usage.
