"""Content pins for the cross-repo toolchain this CI executes (A c35 shape,
two-leg form ported from B's c30 railsite ship).

This CI RUNS tianzhicdev/secretgate-action@<ref>, which in turn fetches
tianzhicdev/secretgate@<version-default> and executes it. Both are pins by
REFERENCE (a tag), not by CONTENT: a force-moved tag or a missed repoint
means this job verifies — and gates on — bytes the fleet does not believe it
is running. B c30 proved this class LIVE: railsite's @v1.2.2 froze the
engine default at v1.2.0, so the strict-scan gate silently ran two-generation
old suppression-buggy regexes for a generation. This step pins BOTH layers
by sha256:

  1. ACTION  : action.yml @ $PIN_ACTION_REF  == $PIN_ACTION_SHA
     (fetched BEFORE the action runs, so a drifted tag fails the job
      instead of executing the drifted code)
  2. ENGINE  : $RUNNER_TEMP/secretgate.py   == $PIN_ENGINE_SHA
     (checked after the action step: proves WHICH engine actually scanned)

Refs are env-passed (never interpolated into code); every read is urllib
with a browser UA so the identical script proves red/green on this host AND
on ubuntu-latest (no curl on this box, no sha256sum flag dialect — digest
compare is pure python; A c35 host/CI parity lesson). Transient transport
errors retry 4x with backoff, then fail closed — a forever-gate must not
convert CDN flakes into red CI, and must never silent-skip (c37 lesson).

Exit codes: 0 all pins hold, 1 a pin is red (drift/force-move/fetch dead),
2 bad usage.
