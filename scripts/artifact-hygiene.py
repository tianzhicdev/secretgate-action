"""Artifact-hygiene rail (A c50, C c40 shape adapted to this repo).

The accident class is fleet-born, not hypothetical: C's ethkey-lite silently
SHIPPED two CI byproducts (composite-run.sh + step.log) as tracked files for
15 commits on a public Pages URL — a local test run of a CI step staged its
scratch files (C c25/c40). The fix that pins it forever reads `git ls-files`
(INDEX authority — a .gitignore entry never untracks what was committed
before it existed) instead of scanning the disk.

What THIS repo's CI writes inside the checkout (inventory @c50):
  - the negative-controls job checks out the verifier tool to
    `.ethkey-tools/ethkey.py` via actions/checkout `path:` — on disk during
    any local replay of that step, `git add -A` would stage it.
  - NO *.log redirect exists here (this repo makes no python-version claim,
    hence no py39-floor job; the engine is fetched to RUNNER_TEMP, outside
    the checkout).
The rails this repo must never lose:

  A. BLOCKLIST: no generated-file / checked-out-tool path may ever be
     tracked again.
  B. SCRATCH SWEEP: no tracked *.log / *.out at any depth (the step.log
     class generalized by extension, so a NEW log name is caught even when
     nobody added it to leg A).
  D. CHECKOUT-PATH INVENTORY (A c54, C c44 offer): every job-level
     `actions/checkout` with a relative `path:` WRITES a whole directory
     into the checkout at CI time. The A c50 rail hand-listed
     `.ethkey-tools/ethkey.py`; leg D DERIVES the prefix set from the
     .github YAML text (stdlib line-scan, no PyYAML) so the NEXT `path:`
     step is covered without anyone editing a list, and the derived set is
     PRINTED (C c44 announce-yourself rule) so it can never derive vacuously.
  C. DOC DENOMINATOR: any tracked .md outside proofs/ must be named in
     DOC_ALLOW (README today). A new tracked .md that is neither a receipt
     nor an allowed doc goes RED — catches a RENAMED byproduct that
     bypassed the blocklist.
  E. BLOCKLIST<->IGNORE PARITY (A c55, B c44 offer): a blocklist entry that
     no .gitignore line covers is a CATCH WITH NO PREVENT — it stops the
     commit but never stops the staging, so every `git add -A` replays the
     accident. Authority is `git check-ignore --no-index` (B c43: ask git,
     don't reimplement fnmatch); a check-ignore crash is a crash, not a
     verdict: exit 2 WITH A NAME. Covers leg A names AND leg D's derived
     checkout prefixes (here leg A is empty by design, so the whole live
     surface — the derived checkout dir — rides this leg; an unchecked-out
     checkout dir stages on `git add -A` = exactly C's c40 accident route).
     The OK line PRINTS the covered set (announce-yourself) so vacuous
     coverage is visible.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a violation is printed, 2 bad usage / no git repo.
