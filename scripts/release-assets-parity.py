"""Release assets x committed proofs parity (C c28 rail, A port, cycle 37;
credential-hardened c52 + c53).

C's ethkey-lite selftest pin (fc6671a) walks THREE rails between GitHub
releases and the committed proofs/ dir; my repos claimed the same
'every release carries a signed receipt' story but only pinned it in ONE
direction (receipts verify via CLI). A c37 audit of my own 3 repos against
this rail found REAL gaps (orphan assets, committed-never-attached drift,
a v1.0.0 release with zero assets) — fixed in the same commit that lands
this pin, so the baseline is green from day one.

Rails (all must hold or exit 1):
  (a) every release ASSET exists in proofs/ byte-identically (silently
      re-uploading an altered asset = stranger verifies != repo shows);
  (b) every committed version receipt in proofs/ is attached to a release
      (committed-but-never-uploaded = the claim is a lie for that version);
  (c) an asset's embedded version == its release tag's version, zero-
      normalized (v0.8 == v0.8.0 — C's own false-fail bug class).

Config per repo: REPO constant; VERSION_FILE_RE classifies committed
version receipts (fixtures excluded). Leg (c) reads releases from the
GitHub API; set RELEASES_JSON=/path/to/releases.json to run against a
saved snapshot (flip controls use this — (c) is data-driven and must be
provable non-vacuous locally).

Credential discipline (C c43 three legs, claimed + one leg added):
The unauthenticated api.github.com GET is a STRUCTURAL cap, not a
transient — 60 req/h per shared runner IP; retries cannot fix exhaustion
(my hookpack run 33352533925 attempt 1 went RED on exactly this after 4
retries). In CI the step passes GITHUB_TOKEN (per-job 5000/h).
  * Host-SCOPED attach (C c43) — Authorization is built ONLY when the
    request host is EXACTLY api.github.com. Host EQUALITY, not substring:
    the api host embedded in another URL's path/query must not earn it.
  * Cross-host REDIRECT STRIP (A c53 — the leg host-scope at attach time
    does NOT provide): urllib's redirect handler COPIES the caller's
    headers onto the redirect request, hostname changes included — a
    live two-hop catcher proves a token attached for host A rides a 302
    to host B. Asset downloads go github.com -> objects.githubusercontent.
    com; a token must never ride that arrow even if a future refactor
    attaches at the download leg, and an api-side redirect would smuggle
    it out the same way. Our opener therefore strips Authorization from
    every redirect whose target hostname differs from the source's.
  * Fail-closed wiring (C c43) — inside CI (GITHUB_ACTIONS=true) a
    missing token is a wiring defect: exit 2, never a silent degrade
    back to the 60/h shared-IP cap. Outside CI, unauthenticated is an
    honest local mode and the run SAYS so (an exemption that announces
    itself).
  * Structural != transient (C c43) — an HTTP 4xx (bad/expired token,
    404) fails FAST and names its status; only transport errors and 5xx
    retry (3 attempts, backoff). Retrying a 401 is theater.

--selftest runs the credential matrix offline (host-scope baits incl.
substring hosts, empty-token, the redirect-strip unit pair same-host /
cross-host, and the 4xx-vs-5xx classifier). Exit codes: 0 green,
1 violation, 2 bad usage / bad wiring. Run from the repo root; stdlib only.
