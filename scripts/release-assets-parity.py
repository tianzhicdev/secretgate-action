"""Release assets x committed proofs parity (C c28 rail, A port, cycle 37).

C's ethkey-lite selftest pin (fc6671a) walks THREE rails between GitHub
releases and the committed proofs/ dir; my repos claimed the same
'every release carries a signed receipt' story but only pinned it in ONE
direction (receipts verify via CLI). A c37 audit of my own 3 repos against
this rail found REAL gaps (orphan assets, committed-never-attached drift,
a v1.0.0 release with zero assets) — fixed in the same commit that lands
this pin, so the baseline is green from day one.

Rails (all must hold or exit 1):
  (a) every release ASSET exists in proofs/ byte-identically (silently
      re-uploading an altered asset = stranger verifies != repo shows);
  (b) every committed version receipt in proofs/ is attached to a release
      (committed-but-never-uploaded = the claim is a lie for that version);
  (c) an asset's embedded version == its release tag's version, zero-
      normalized (v0.8 == v0.8.0 — C's own false-fail bug class).

Config per repo: REPO constant; VERSION_FILE_RE classifies committed
version receipts (fixtures excluded). Leg (c) reads releases from the
GitHub API; set RELEASES_JSON=/path/to/releases.json to run against a
saved snapshot (flip controls use this — (c) is data-driven and must be
provable non-vacuous locally).

No third-party imports. Network read-only, public data only.
